# 🚀 AI and Software Development: The risk of the technology

## 👨🏻‍💻 Vibe Coding and software development 
In software development, the idea of AI replacing human jobs has become a forecast pushed into the general imagination. Large companies often justify massive layoffs by claiming AI increases productivity, essentially attempting to prove this self-fulfilling prophecy right. What is definitely true is that AI will fundamentally change software development and any work involving computers or information.

However, it is harder to imagine the human factor being eliminated entirely. Why? Because coding has never been the hardest part of development; solving complex needs with whatever tools are available is the real challenge.

As a software engineer, the goal is not to become a "prompt engineer," even though it is important to include those abilities in your toolbox. Instead, you should use your knowledge of coding, infrastructure, and AI to leverage better code quality—using AI tools as a "coding buddy" without outsourcing your career or your responsibility.

I follow three rules to ensure I use AI effectively without falling into the trap of "Vibe Coding":

1. The "Understanding First" Cycle

    Don't jump straight into implementation without understanding the underlying logic. Use AI to "extract patterns" and understand the problem space before writing a single line.
    - *The Principle*: AI should never make the final decision; it should only provide the information needed for you to make the decision.

2. Manual Writing and Code Ownership

    By writing the code yourself after analyzing AI-generated patterns, you guarantee that you understand the "why" behind every line.
    - *The Principle*: Use AI to explore different approaches, but evaluate which one is right for your specific context using your own expertise. Writing it yourself avoids "black box" code that fails in production for reasons nobody understands.

3. AI as a Code Reviewer

    Analyzing your code with AI after you have written it is one of the most effective modern practices.
    - *The Principle*: This allows you to find blind spots (like security vulnerabilities or memory leaks) from a position of control. If the AI suggests a change, you must have the technical criteria to decide if that improvement fits your architecture or if it might introduce a new bug.
