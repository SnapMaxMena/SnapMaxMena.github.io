# 🚀 AI and Software Development: The risk of the technology

## 👨🏻‍💻 Vibe Coding and software development 
In software development the idea of losing jobs has been, a forecast that has been pushed in the general imagination, and big companies justify big layouts, because of AI proving rigth this self fulfilling profecy.
What is definitely truth is that AI will change software developmemt and any work related with computers or information.

What is harder to actually see happened, is the human factor to be eliminated, why? software development and coding has never been the hard part, solving the need with whatever is available is the hard part. 

And this is the point of this writing, as software engineer, the plan is not to become a prompt engineer even though is important to include the same abilities in your tool box. 

You can use your knowledge in coding and infrastructure and AI to leverage a best code quality, using whatever ai coding tool as a buddy but not outsourcing the caree or your responsibility.
I have 3 steps or rules that consider are useful to always have in mind,

1. The "Understanding First" Cycle
The video criticizes those who jump straight into implementation without understanding the logic. Your process of "extracting patterns to understand" before writing ensures that you are building the mental model that the video's author mentions as the most critical skill.
• Opinion: Use the AI to make the decisions; I use AI to inform myself, and then make the decisions.
2. Manual Writing and Code Ownership
By writing the code yourself after analyzing the patterns, you are guaranteeing that you know the "why" behind every single line.
• Opinion: I use AI to explore different approaches but evaluate which one is right for the specific context using my own expertise. By writing it myself, I avoid the "black box" code that fails no one knows why?
3. AI as a Code Reviewer
Analyzing your code with AI after you have written it is one of the best current practices.
• Opinion: This allows me to find blind spots that I might have overlooked, from a position of control. If the AI suggests a change, I have the criteria to decide whether that improvement might break something else in my architecture.
